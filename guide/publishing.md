# Publishing

Publishing makes your campaign accessible to users. Before publishing, make sure your form is complete and tested.

## Pre-Publishing Checks

Formulr automatically checks your campaign:

### Blocking Errors

These errors must be corrected before publishing:

- ❌ **Empty sections**: each section must contain at least one module
- ❌ **Unconfigured modules**: all modules must have a label

### Warnings

These points deserve attention but don't block:

- ⚠️ No required modules
- ⚠️ No owner assigned
- ⚠️ No deadline defined

## Publishing a Campaign

1. Verify your campaign is ready
2. Click the **"Publish"** button in the top right
3. The campaign is now accessible

The status changes from "Draft" to "Published".

## Publishing States

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Not published, invisible to users |
| **Published** | Accessible via sharing link |
| **Unpublished changes** | Published with pending changes |

## Editing a Published Campaign

You can edit a campaign after publishing:

1. Make your changes in the editor
2. The status changes to "Unpublished changes"
3. Click **"Publish update"**

::: warning Important
Changes are applied immediately after publishing.
Responses in progress will see the changes.
:::

## Unpublishing a Campaign

To remove access to a campaign:

1. Click on the **"Publish"** menu
2. Select **"Unpublish"**
3. The campaign becomes a draft again

Users will no longer be able to access the form.
Existing responses are preserved.

## Sharing the Campaign

Once published, share your campaign:

### Direct Link

1. Go to the **Settings** tab
2. **Sharing** section
3. Copy the link

The link looks like: `https://app.formulr.fr/c/xxxxx`

### Email Invitation

1. In the Sharing section
2. Enter email addresses
3. Validate with Enter
4. Click **Send**

Recipients receive a personalized email with:
- The campaign name
- A direct link
- Your organization name

## Testing Before Publishing

::: tip Advice
Test your form before sharing it widely.
:::

Testing options:

1. **Preview**: view the rendering without creating a response
2. **Self-test**: fill out the form yourself
3. **Internal test**: share with a colleague first

## Access Tracking

After publishing, track activity:

- Number of views
- Number of responses started
- Number of responses completed
- Completion rate

These statistics are visible in the **Responses** tab.
